I have completed the project 05.

As I wasn't sure of the requirement about changing some styling was referred to make changes to the css or changing the style with javascript I've included both of them.

- The gallery shows 12 randoms user cards each time you reload the page.
- Each of the cards is clickable and it will show you the modal with more info. You can change the modals with buttons inside them.
- You can filter by name the cards. If there's a match with some card, it will show you the card alone and it will change the background to green for just a moment. If there isn't, it will show you all cards, an alert, and it will change the background to red for just a moment.
